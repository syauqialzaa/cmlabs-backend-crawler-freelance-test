## Task Requirements

With `puppeteer` package, we do not explicitly specify whether a website is SPA (Single Page Application), SSR (Server-Side Rendering), or PWA (Progressive Web App). Therefore, we need to look at the characteristics or traits of each type of website to identify them.

Here are some common traits that can help identify website types:

1. ***SPA (Single Page Application)***, The use of JavaScript to load and replace page content without reloading the entire page. Use of JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
2. ***SSR (Server-Side Rendering)***, Pages are generated by the server before being delivered to the client. Generally has a faster initial page load time than SPA.
3. ***PWA (Progressive Web App)***, Accessible through a web browser, but can be installed and used independently of the browser. Utilizes service workers technology to provide an offline experience and faster loading.

## Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create `.env` file then write the lines of code as shown in the `.env.example` file and adjust with yours
4. Run `npm run start:prod` for production mode or `npm run start:dev` for development mode with nodemon

## Usage

Use this simple API with postman (https://www.postman.com/). The request is:
- method: **POST**
- path: **http://localhost:3000/crawler**
- payload:
